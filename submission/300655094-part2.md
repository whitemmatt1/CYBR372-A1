 Looking at my code the CLI outputs status codes that don't specifcially show whether there was a padding error or not.

 But looking at the example code shown, the python wrapper forwards the stderr so, when looking at my decryptor.java i have a catch (Exception e), which would capture bad padding exceptions and print them to stderr and send a DECRYPTION_ERROR status code. 
 
 This creates a clear oracle that can be used by an attacker can recover the plaintext without having access to the decryption key.
