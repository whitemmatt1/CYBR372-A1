AES itself wasn’t broken, the weakness was in the key space. AES with 128-bit or 256-bit keys is practically unbreakable by brute force. However, the key wasn’t chosen at random from that enormous space. Instead, it was derived from a 4-digit PIN. That reduces the attacker’s search space from 2^128 down to 10,000.

A brute-force attacker can simply test all 10,000 candidate PINs in seconds. Because we were given the ciphertext and the corresponding known plaintext, we could immediately detect when decryption was correct.
So the vulnerability wasn’t in AES at all, but in the weak key.
